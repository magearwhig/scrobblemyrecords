# RecordScrobbles Roadmap

## Feature 0: Foundations

Cross-cutting concerns to address before or alongside feature development.

### Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Completed:**
- 0A: Security Baseline (already in place before this work)
- 0B: API Conventions - `stats.ts`, `images.ts`, and `wishlist.ts` routes created following `/api/v1/` pattern
- 0D: In-App Notification System - `NotificationBell` component with dropdown, `useNotifications` hook, localStorage persistence
- 0E: Extended Analytics Infrastructure - `StatsService` created with comprehensive stats methods
- Image caching service (`imageService.ts`) with Last.fm and Discogs integration
- All stats-related types defined in `shared/types.ts`
- Full test coverage for new routes and services

**Completed (continued):**
- 0C: Data Evolution & Storage - All 4 phases complete ✅ - See `.plan/data-evolution-plan.md`

**Note on Dependencies:**
- 0C (Data Evolution) is a prerequisite for Feature 9 (Backup & Restore)
- Streak milestone notifications (Feature 1) require integration with 0D (complete)

### 0A: Security Baseline

**Server Binding:**
- Ensure backend binds to `127.0.0.1` only (not `0.0.0.0`)
- Document opt-in for LAN exposure if ever needed

**Path Traversal Protection:**
- Audit all file-based endpoints for path traversal vulnerabilities
- Validate usernames and file paths before constructing paths
- Use allowlist approach for file operations

**Token/Secret Hygiene:**
- Audit logging to ensure tokens, signatures, and API keys are never logged
- Review `ENCRYPTION_KEY` requirements - require strong key, no weak defaults

### 0B: API Conventions

All new endpoints must follow existing `/api/v1/` prefix pattern:
- Stats: `/api/v1/stats/...`
- Wishlist: `/api/v1/wishlist/...`
- Images: `/api/v1/images/...`
- Sellers: `/api/v1/sellers/...`
- Patterns: `/api/v1/patterns/...` *(planned - Feature 3)*
- Releases: `/api/v1/releases/...` *(planned - Feature 5)*
- Backup: `/api/v1/backup/...` *(planned - Feature 10)*

Route modules:

**Implemented:**
- `src/backend/routes/stats.ts` ✅
- `src/backend/routes/wishlist.ts` ✅
- `src/backend/routes/images.ts` ✅
- `src/backend/routes/sellers.ts` ✅
- `src/backend/routes/releases.ts` ✅

**Planned (not yet created):**
- `src/backend/routes/patterns.ts` *(Feature 3: Smart Scrobble Scheduling)*

**Recently Implemented:**
- `src/backend/routes/backup.ts` ✅ *(Feature 10: Backup & Restore)*

### 0C: Data Evolution & Storage

> **Status: COMPLETE ✅** (January 2026)

**All phases complete:**
- [x] Phase 1: Schema Infrastructure - `MigrationService`, `timestamps.ts`, types, server integration
- [x] Phase 2: Version Stamping - Array wrapping for legacy files, client-side localStorage stamping
- [x] Phase 3: Cleanup Routines - `cleanupService.ts` with image/seller/versions cache cleanup
- [x] Phase 4: Documentation - Timestamp conventions documented in code

**Key Implementations:**
- Server lock file to prevent multiple instances (prevents credential corruption)
- Credential protection: blocks saving empty tokens over existing tokens
- Array-based files wrapped in versioned objects during migration
- Cache cleanup runs after migrations on startup (non-blocking)

### 0D: In-App Notification System

**UI Component: Notification Panel**

Add a notification area to the app UI (e.g., bell icon in header with dropdown):
- Shows recent alerts/notifications
- Badge count for unread items
- Persisted to localStorage

```typescript
interface AppNotification {
  id: string;
  type: 'info' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'alert';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: number;
  read: boolean;
  action?: {
    label: string;
    route: string;           // Navigate to this page (primary action)
    externalUrl?: string;    // Open in browser (secondary action)
  };
}
```

**Notification Panel Behavior:**
- Click notification → navigate to `route` (in-app page)
- If `externalUrl` present, show secondary "Open in Discogs/MusicBrainz" link
- Both options clearly visible so user can choose

**Use Cases:**
- "New vinyl pressing available for [Album]" (Feature 2)
- "Wishlist item at local seller!" (Feature 4)
- "Artist [X] has a new release" (Feature 5)
- "You hit a 30-day listening streak!" (Feature 1)
- Sync errors or warnings

**Implementation:**
- `src/renderer/components/NotificationPanel.tsx`
- `src/renderer/hooks/useNotifications.ts`
- Store in localStorage key: `recordscrobbles.notifications`
- Max 50 notifications, auto-prune oldest

### 0E: Extend Existing Analytics Infrastructure

**Existing Services:**

`ScrobbleHistoryStorage` (`src/backend/services/scrobbleHistoryStorage.ts`) provides:
- `getHourlyDistribution()` - Scrobbles by hour of day
- `getDayOfWeekDistribution()` - Scrobbles by day of week
- `getAlbumHistory()` - Play history for specific album
- `getUniqueArtists()` - All artists with play counts
- `getAllAlbums()` - All albums with play history

`AnalyticsService` (`src/backend/services/analyticsService.ts`) wraps the above and adds:
- `getTopArtistsMap()` - Top artists with weighted play counts
- `getAnalyticsSummary()` - Total scrobbles, unique albums/artists, peak hours
- `getAlbumCompleteness()` - Album completion detection
- `getTimeOfDayPreference()` - Current listening likelihood

**Strategy for Stats Dashboard:**
- Create `StatsService` that uses `AnalyticsService` + `ScrobbleHistoryStorage`
- Add new methods for streaks, source breakdown, collection coverage
- Avoid duplicating existing logic - call through to existing services

- 1661 tests passing with 60%+ coverage

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Streak milestone notifications (notification system 0D exists, integration pending)

### Overview
Comprehensive statistics dashboard showing listening patterns, streaks, source breakdown (this app vs Spotify vs others), and collection engagement metrics.

### Feasibility & Design Decisions

**Source Breakdown - IMPORTANT LIMITATION:**

After investigation, Last.fm's public API does **NOT** expose scrobble source/player information:
- The `track.scrobble` API accepts a `context` parameter for source, but this data is "not public, only enabled for certain API keys" per Last.fm documentation
- There is no way to retrieve which app/player submitted a scrobble via the public API
- Last.fm Pro subscription does not provide additional API access for source data
- This is an API limitation, not a RecordScrobbles limitation

**Current Implementation (Workaround):**
- RecordScrobbles identifies its own scrobbles by matching timestamps from saved session files
- When scrobbles are submitted, session data (including timestamps) is saved locally
- Source breakdown compares history timestamps against session file timestamps (5-second tolerance)
- Scrobbles matching session timestamps are marked "RecordScrobbles", others are "Other"

**Limitation of Current Approach:**
- If session files in `data/scrobbles/sessions/` are deleted, source attribution is lost
- All scrobbles would then appear as "Other" since there's no way to recover source from Last.fm
- This is a fragile solution but the best available given Last.fm API constraints

**Original Plan (Not Feasible):**
- ~~Last.fm scrobble data may not reliably include source for all scrobbles~~
- ~~Need to investigate what Last.fm API actually returns in scrobble metadata~~
- ~~Fallback: categorize as "This App" (scrobbles made through recordscrobbles) vs "Other"~~
- ~~This app's scrobbles can be identified by checking if timestamp matches a known scrobble we submitted~~

**Listening Hours Calculation:**
- Track duration source: Use Last.fm `track.getInfo` for duration, or estimate ~3.5 min/track if unavailable
- Gap handling: If gap between consecutive scrobbles > 30 min, assume new session
- Don't count gap time as listening time

**Streak Day Boundary:**
- Use user's local timezone for day boundaries
- A "day" runs from local midnight to local midnight
- Store streak data with UTC timestamps but calculate boundaries in local time

**Album Completion Detection:**
- Reuse existing `AnalyticsService.getAlbumCompleteness()` logic
- "Complete" = played 80%+ of tracks within a 3-hour window

### Phase 1A: Stats Calculation Service

**Backend: `src/backend/services/statsService.ts`**

Calculate stats from synced scrobble history:

```typescript
interface ListeningStats {
  // Streaks
  currentDailyStreak: number;
  longestDailyStreak: number;
  currentCollectionStreak: number;  // Days listening to owned albums
  albumsCompletedThisMonth: number;
  newArtistsThisMonth: number;

  // Time-based
  scrobblesToday: number;
  scrobblesThisWeek: number;
  scrobblesThisMonth: number;
  scrobblesThisYear: number;
  scrobblesAllTime: number;

  listeningHoursToday: number;
  listeningHoursThisWeek: number;
  listeningHoursThisMonth: number;

  // Source breakdown
  sourceBreakdown: {
    source: string;  // 'recordscrobbles', 'Spotify', 'Apple Music', etc.
    count: number;
    percentage: number;
  }[];

  // Collection stats
  collectionCoverageThisMonth: number;  // % of owned albums played
  collectionCoverageThisYear: number;
  dustyCorners: AlbumInfo[];  // Owned albums not played in 6+ months
  heavyRotation: AlbumPlayCount[];  // Most played owned albums

  // Top lists
  topArtistsThisWeek: ArtistPlayCount[];
  topArtistsThisMonth: ArtistPlayCount[];
  topArtistsThisYear: ArtistPlayCount[];
  topArtistsAllTime: ArtistPlayCount[];

  topAlbumsThisWeek: AlbumPlayCount[];
  topAlbumsThisMonth: AlbumPlayCount[];
  topAlbumsThisYear: AlbumPlayCount[];
  topAlbumsAllTime: AlbumPlayCount[];

  // Milestones
  totalScrobbles: number;
  nextMilestone: number;  // 10K, 25K, 50K, 100K, etc.
  scrobblesToNextMilestone: number;
  milestoneHistory: { milestone: number; date: number }[];

  // Patterns
  peakListeningHours: { hour: number; dayOfWeek: number; count: number }[];
  weekdayVsWeekend: { weekday: number; weekend: number };
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/stats/overview` - Main stats summary
- `GET /api/v1/stats/streaks` - Streak data
- `GET /api/v1/stats/sources` - Source breakdown

- `GET /api/v1/stats/heatmap` - Calendar heatmap data
- `GET /api/v1/stats/dusty-corners` - Albums owned but not played recently

**Data Processing:**
- Parse scrobble history index for play data
- Cross-reference with collection for owned albums
- Extract source from scrobble metadata (if available in Last.fm data)
- Calculate streaks by checking consecutive days with scrobbles

### Phase 1B: Stats Dashboard Page

### Phase 1C: Stats Components

**New Components:**
- `src/renderer/components/stats/StreakCard.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/stats/SourcePieChart.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/stats/CalendarHeatmap.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/stats/ListeningTimeline.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/stats/TopList.tsx` - Handles both albums (with covers) and artists (with images)
- `src/renderer/components/stats/MilestoneProgress.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/stats/DustyCornersSection.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/stats/AlbumCard.tsx` - Reusable album display with cover
- `src/renderer/components/stats/ArtistCard.tsx` - Reusable artist display with image

**Charting Library:**
- Consider using lightweight library like `recharts` or `chart.js`
- Or build simple SVG-based components for basic charts

### Phase 1E: Image Sources & Caching

**Album Cover Sources (in priority order):**
1. **Discogs collection cache** - Already have cover URLs from collection sync
2. **Last.fm API** - `album.getInfo` returns album images
3. **Discogs API** - Fallback for non-collection albums

**Artist Image Sources:**
1. **Last.fm API** - `artist.getInfo` returns artist images (though Last.fm deprecated large images)
2. **Discogs API** - `GET /artists/{id}` includes images
3. **MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive** - Alternative source
4. **Spotify API** - Has good artist images (would require additional auth)

**Image Handling:**
- Cache fetched images locally to avoid repeated API calls
- Use placeholder/fallback for missing images (generic vinyl icon for albums, silhouette for artists)
- Lazy load images as they scroll into view
- Store image URLs in stats cache alongside play data

**Backend: `src/backend/services/imageService.ts`**

```typescript
interface ImageService {
  getAlbumCover(artist: string, album: string): Promise<string | null>;
  getArtistImage(artist: string): Promise<string | null>;
  getCachedImages(items: { artist: string; album?: string }[]): Promise<ImageCache>;
}

interface ImageCache {
  albums: { [key: string]: string };  // "artist|album" -> URL
  artists: { [key: string]: string }; // "artist" -> URL
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/images/album?artist=X&album=Y` - Get album cover URL
- `GET /api/v1/images/artist?name=X` - Get artist image URL
- `POST /api/v1/images/batch` - Batch fetch multiple images

**Data Storage:**
- `images/album-covers.json` - Cached album cover URLs
- `images/artist-images.json` - Cached artist image URLs

### Visual Design Considerations

**Consistent Album Display:**
- Standard cover sizes: 50px (list items), 100px (cards), 150px (featured)
- Rounded corners (4-8px) for album covers
- Subtle shadow/border for depth
- Fallback: Dark gray placeholder with vinyl icon

**Consistent Artist Display:**
- Circular crop for artist images
- Standard sizes: 50px (list), 80px (cards)
- Fallback: Dark gray circle with music note or silhouette icon

**Color Scheme:**
- Use existing app color palette
- Accent colors for charts that complement album art
- Dark backgrounds make album covers pop

**Typography:**
- Play counts in monospace or tabular numbers for alignment
- Artist names slightly bolder than album titles
- Truncate long names with ellipsis

**Responsive Layout:**
- Cards reflow on smaller screens
- Album grids adjust column count
- Charts resize gracefully

### Phase 1D: Streak Tracking

**Backend Enhancement:**

Track streaks in real-time:
- Update streak counts when new scrobbles are synced
- Store streak history for display
- Detect streak milestones (7 days, 30 days, 100 days, 365 days)

**Streak Types:**
1. **Daily Listening Streak** - Any scrobble counts
2. **Collection Streak** - Days playing owned albums (requires cross-referencing)
3. **Album Completion Streak** - Detect when most/all tracks of album played in sequence
4. **Discovery Streak** - Days with new artist listens

## Feature 2: Discogs Wishlist & Vinyl Availability Tracking

### Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Completed:**
- Wishlist sync service (`wishlistService.ts`) with Discogs integration
- Wishlist API routes (`/api/v1/wishlist/*`) for sync, versions, settings, and local want list
- `WishlistPage.tsx` with tabbed interface (All, Has Vinyl, CD Only, Affordable, Wanted)
- Vinyl version detection and marketplace price fetching
- Local Want List feature for Discovery integration (albums played frequently but not owned)
- Watch list for CD-only items with vinyl availability checking
- Notification integration for vinyl availability alerts
- Settings integration (price threshold, currency, auto-sync interval)
- Discovery page enhancements:
  - "In Wantlist" badge for albums in Discogs wantlist (purple)
  - "Wanted" badge for albums in local want list (green)
  - "Hide wanted" toggle to filter out items already on wantlist/wanted
  - Differentiated badge colors for visual distinction
- 42 backend integration tests + 19 frontend component tests + 43 Discovery tests
- All wishlist types defined in `shared/types.ts`

**Implementation Details:**
- Version cache: 7 days for vinyl availability data
- Price cache: 24 hours for marketplace stats
- Progressive scanning: 10-20 masters per sync session
- Vinyl detection: "Vinyl", "LP", "12\"", "10\"", "7\"" formats

### Overview
Track albums at the **master release level** (not specific pressings), monitor for vinyl availability, and integrate with Discovery to show which albums are vinyl-available vs CD-only. Focus is exclusively on vinyl - no interest in CD or other formats.

### Feasibility & Design Decisions

**Master vs Release Mapping:**
- Discogs wishlist stores specific releases, not master releases
- Each wishlist item has a `master_id` we can extract
- Strategy: Fetch wishlist, extract master_id from each release, group by master
- Display shows master-level info but stores original release_id for reference

**API Call Bounding for Version Scanning:**
- Scanning all versions of all wishlist items could be expensive (1 API call per master)
- Bound: Max 100 wishlist items scanned per sync
- Bound: Max 50 versions fetched per master (paginated endpoint)
- Cache version data for 7 days to avoid repeated lookups
- Progressive sync: scan 10-20 masters per day rather than all at once

**Vinyl Detection:**
- Check `format` field in version data for: "Vinyl", "LP", "12\"", "10\"", "7\""
- Exclude: "CD", "Cassette", "File", "DVD"
- Store list of vinyl version IDs for each master

**Price Data:**
- `GET /marketplace/stats/{release_id}` returns price statistics
- Only fetch for vinyl versions
- Cache for 24 hours (prices change)
- Note: Requires separate API call per release - expensive for large wishlists

### Phase 2A: Wishlist Sync Service

**Backend: `src/backend/services/wishlistService.ts`**

Create a new service to sync and manage Discogs wishlist data:

```typescript
interface WishlistItem {
  masterId: number;
  releaseId: number;           // The specific release in wishlist (for reference)
  artist: string;
  title: string;
  dateAdded: number;           // When added to Discogs wishlist
  hasVinyl: boolean;           // Does ANY vinyl pressing exist?
  vinylVersionCount: number;   // How many vinyl versions exist
  vinylPriceRange?: {
    min: number;
    max: number;
    median: number;
    currency: string;
  };
  lastChecked: number;         // When we last scanned versions
  isAffordable?: boolean;      // Below user's price threshold
}

interface WishlistSyncStatus {
  status: 'idle' | 'syncing' | 'completed' | 'error';
  lastSync: number | null;
  totalItems: number;
  itemsWithVinyl: number;
  itemsCdOnly: number;
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/wishlist` - Get all wishlist items with vinyl status
- `GET /api/v1/wishlist/sync` - Get sync status
- `POST /api/v1/wishlist/sync` - Trigger wishlist sync from Discogs
- `GET /api/v1/wishlist/:masterId/versions` - Get all versions of a master release
- `POST /api/v1/wishlist/settings` - Save settings (price threshold, etc.)

**Discogs API Calls:**
1. `GET /users/{username}/wants` - Fetch full wishlist
2. `GET /masters/{master_id}/versions` - Get all pressings for each item
3. `GET /marketplace/stats/{release_id}` - Get price data for vinyl versions

**Data Storage:**
- `wishlist/wishlist-items.json` - Cached wishlist with vinyl status
- `wishlist/wishlist-settings.json` - User settings (price threshold)
- `wishlist/sync-status.json` - Sync progress/status

**Rate Limiting Considerations:**
- Wishlist sync involves many API calls (1 per master release for versions)
- Implement progressive sync with delays (similar to collection preloader)
- Cache version/format data for 7 days (vinyl availability changes rarely)
- Cache price data for 24 hours (prices change frequently)

### Phase 2B: Wishlist Page (Frontend)

**New Page: `src/renderer/pages/WishlistPage.tsx`**

Features:
- Display all wishlist items grouped by vinyl availability
- Filters:
  - "All Items"
  - "Has Vinyl" (show only items with vinyl pressings)
  - "CD Only" (show items without vinyl - for watching)
  - "Affordable Vinyl" (under price threshold)
- Sort options:
  - Date added to wishlist
  - Price (lowest vinyl)
  - Artist name
  - Album title
- Each item shows:
  - Artist - Album
  - Vinyl status badge (green "Vinyl Available", gray "CD Only", yellow "Vinyl $$$")
  - Price range for vinyl versions (if available)
  - Link to Discogs marketplace
  - "Check Versions" button to view all pressings

**Sync Status Bar:**
- Reuse pattern from `SyncStatusBar.tsx`
- Show "Last synced: X hours ago"
- "Sync Now" button

### Phase 2C: Discovery Integration

**Modify: `src/backend/services/vinylAvailabilityService.ts`** (new)

Service to check vinyl availability for Discovery items:
- When Discovery loads missing albums, check each against Discogs for vinyl versions
- Cache results to avoid repeated API calls
- Background job to periodically update availability

**Modify: `src/renderer/pages/DiscoveryPage.tsx`**

Add to each Discovery album card:
- Vinyl status badge
- Price indicator (if vinyl available)
- "Add to Wishlist" button (adds master release to Discogs wishlist)
- "Watch for Vinyl" button (for CD-only items - local tracking)

**New Filters on Discovery:**
- "Show All"
- "Vinyl Available"
- "CD Only"
- "Affordable Vinyl (under $X)"

### Phase 2D: Watch for Vinyl Feature

**Backend: `src/backend/services/vinylWatchService.ts`**

For CD-only albums on Discovery that user wants to track:
- Store list of "watched" albums locally
- Periodically check if vinyl versions become available
- Generate notifications when vinyl is added

**Data Storage:**
- `discovery/vinyl-watch-list.json`

### Phase 2E: Settings

**Modify: `src/renderer/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`**

Add "Wishlist" tab with:
- Price threshold setting (default: $40)
- Auto-sync interval (daily, weekly, manual only)
- Currency preference

---

## Feature 3: Smart Scrobble Scheduling

### Status: PLANNED

### Implementation Plan
See `.plan/smart-scrobble-scheduling-plan.md` for full specification including:
- `ListeningPatternService` for pattern learning from scrobble history
- `/api/v1/patterns/*` routes for suggestions and conflict detection
- `QuickTimePresets.tsx` for enhanced timestamp selection
- `BackfillDialog.tsx` for batch album scrobbling
- `ListeningQueueWidget.tsx` for real-time session tracking (Phase 4)

### Overview
Make backfilling scrobbles easier with intelligent timestamp suggestions, batch operations, and a listening queue system.

### Feasibility & Design Decisions

**Last.fm Timestamp Constraints:**
- Last.fm accepts scrobbles with timestamps up to 2 weeks in the past
- Timestamps must be Unix epoch seconds
- Cannot scrobble to the future
- Duplicate detection: same track + timestamp = rejected

**Conflict Resolution UX:**
- Before scrobbling, check existing scrobbles for that time window
- Show warning: "You have scrobbles between 7pm-9pm on this date"
- Options: "Scrobble anyway" / "Adjust times" / "Cancel"
- Auto-adjust: Shift proposed timestamps to fill gaps around existing scrobbles

**Pattern Learning Approach:**
- Analyze last 6 months of scrobble history
- Extract: typical start times per day-of-week, session lengths, gaps between albums
- Store computed patterns, refresh weekly
- Use existing `ScrobbleHistoryStorage.getHourlyDistribution()` as foundation

### Phase 3A: Pattern Learning Service

**Backend: `src/backend/services/listeningPatternService.ts`**

Analyze scrobble history to learn user's listening patterns:

```typescript
interface ListeningPatterns {
  // Time-of-day patterns by day of week
  typicalStartTimes: {
    dayOfWeek: number;  // 0-6
    morning: number | null;    // Average start time if they listen in morning
    afternoon: number | null;
    evening: number | null;
  }[];

  // Session patterns
  averageSessionLength: number;  // minutes
  averageGapBetweenAlbums: number;  // minutes
  averageAlbumsPerSession: number;

  // Weekday vs weekend
  weekdayPattern: { start: number; end: number };
  weekendPattern: { start: number; end: number };
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/patterns` - Get learned listening patterns
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/suggest` - Suggest timestamps for albums (body: `{albums: BackfillAlbum[]}`)
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/check-conflicts` - Check for existing scrobbles in time window

### Phase 3B: Backfill Mode

**Frontend: Enhance scrobble dialog**

Add "Backfill Mode" option when scrobbling:

1. Select multiple albums (add to backfill queue)
2. Choose date/time range:
   - Preset: "Yesterday evening", "Last Saturday afternoon", etc.
   - Custom: Date picker with start/end time
3. Preview calculated timestamps based on:
   - Album durations
   - User's typical gaps between albums
   - Learned patterns for that time of day
4. Adjust if needed
5. Submit all scrobbles at once

**UI Flow:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Backfill Listening Session                      │
│                                                 │
│ Albums to scrobble:                             │

### Phase 3C: Quick Backdate Presets

**Modify: Scrobble dialog (`ScrobbleDialog.tsx` or similar)**

Add quick preset buttons:
- "Just now" (current time)
- "Earlier today" (picks typical afternoon time)
- "Yesterday evening" (picks typical evening time based on patterns)
- "Yesterday afternoon"
- "Custom..." (existing date/time picker)

These presets auto-populate based on learned patterns:
- "You usually listen at 8pm on weekday evenings"
- "Your Saturday afternoons typically start around 2pm"

### Phase 3D: Listening Queue

**New Feature: Real-time listening tracker**

For users who want to log as they listen:

1. "Start Listening Session" button
2. Add album to queue → records current time as start
3. "Finished" button → scrobbles with correct start time
4. Automatically calculates gaps and handles overlaps

**State Management:**
```typescript
interface ListeningQueue {
  sessionStarted: number;
  albums: {
    releaseId: number;
    artist: string;
    album: string;
    addedAt: number;      // When added to queue
    finishedAt?: number;  // When marked finished
    scrobbled: boolean;
  }[];
}
```

**Storage:**
- Store in localStorage for persistence across page refreshes
- Auto-save queue state

### Phase 3E: Conflict Detection

**Backend Enhancement:**

When suggesting timestamps:
- Check against existing scrobbles for that time period
- Warn if overlap detected
- Suggest alternative times if conflicts exist

---

## Feature 4: Local Seller Monitoring

### Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Completed:**
- Seller monitoring service (`sellerMonitoringService.ts`) with inventory scanning
- Seller routes (`/api/v1/sellers/*`) for managing monitored sellers and matches
- `SellersPage.tsx` with seller management UI
- Full inventory scanning with progressive pagination
- Page 100+ limit workaround using reverse sort order
- Quick-check for new listings (newest first, page 1 only)
- Match detection against Discogs wishlist (master_id matching)
- Match lifecycle tracking (active/sold/seen status)
- Stale listing cleanup and sold match detection
- Notification integration for new matches
- "View All Matches" page with filtering and sorting
- Match dismissal and "mark as seen" functionality
- Settings integration for scan frequency
- 8 monitored sellers with 10,000+ inventory items scanned

**Implementation Details:**
- Full scan: Weekly per seller (configurable)
- Quick check: Daily for newest listings
- Inventory cache: 24 hours to reduce API calls
- Match by master_id for consistency with wishlist
- Vinyl-only filtering (LP, 12", 10", 7")
- Progressive scan saves progress between sessions

### Overview
Track Discogs inventories of local record shops to find wishlist items available locally. Users maintain a list of seller usernames (typically under 20 local stores), and the app periodically scans their inventories for matches against the user's wishlist.

### Feasibility & Design Decisions

**Scope:**
- Only tracks items on the user's Discogs wishlist (synced via Feature 2)
- Vinyl-only focus (consistent with wishlist feature)
- No price threshold filtering - local availability is the priority
- Equal notification priority with other wishlist alerts

**API Constraints:**
- `GET /users/{username}/inventory` - Paginated seller inventory (up to 100 items/page)
- Rate limit: 60 requests/minute shared with all Discogs operations
- Seller inventories can be large (1000+ items for active shops)
- Strategy: Incremental scan with progress saved between sessions

**Scan Frequency:**
- Full inventory scan: Weekly per seller
- Quick check for new listings: Daily (fetch page 1 sorted by date added)
- Cache seller inventory for 24 hours to avoid redundant calls

**Matching Strategy:**
- Match by master_id when available (consistent with wishlist tracking)
- Fallback to artist/title fuzzy matching for releases without master_id
- Only match vinyl formats (LP, 12", 10", 7")

**Wishlist Dependency:**
- Seller scanning requires wishlist to be synced first
- If wishlist is empty or not synced: show empty state with "Sync Wishlist First" prompt
- Don't attempt seller scans until wishlist has items

**Stale Listing Cleanup:**
- On each scan, compare new matches against existing matches
- If a listing disappears (sold/removed): mark match as `status: 'sold'`
- Sold matches hidden from main view, accessible via "Show Sold" toggle
- Auto-prune sold matches older than 30 days

### Phase 4A: Seller Management Service

**Backend: `src/backend/services/sellerMonitoringService.ts`**

```typescript
interface MonitoredSeller {
  username: string;           // Discogs seller username
  displayName: string;        // User-friendly name (e.g., "Amoeba Music")
  addedAt: number;            // When user added this seller
  lastScanned: number;        // Last full inventory scan
  lastQuickCheck: number;     // Last new listings check
  inventorySize: number;      // Total items in inventory
  matchCount: number;         // Current wishlist matches
}

interface SellerMatch {
  sellerId: string;           // Seller username
  releaseId: number;          // Discogs release ID
  masterId: number;           // Master release ID
  artist: string;
  title: string;
  format: string;             // "LP", "12\"", etc.
  condition: string;          // "Mint", "VG+", etc.
  price: number;
  currency: string;
  listingUrl: string;         // Direct link to listing
  listingId: number;          // Discogs listing ID for tracking
  dateFound: number;          // When we first detected this match
  notified: boolean;          // Have we alerted the user?
  status: 'active' | 'sold' | 'seen';  // Lifecycle state
  statusChangedAt?: number;   // When status last changed
}

interface SellerInventoryCache {
  username: string;
  fetchedAt: number;
  items: {
    releaseId: number;
    masterId?: number;
    artist: string;
    title: string;
    format: string;
    condition: string;
    price: number;
    currency: string;
    listingId: number;
  }[];
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/sellers` - List all monitored sellers with stats
- `POST /api/v1/sellers` - Add a seller to monitor
- `DELETE /api/v1/sellers/:username` - Remove a seller
- `GET /api/v1/sellers/:username/matches` - Get wishlist matches for a seller
- `GET /api/v1/sellers/matches` - Get all matches across all sellers
- `POST /api/v1/sellers/scan` - Trigger manual scan of all sellers
- `GET /api/v1/sellers/scan/status` - Get scan progress

**Discogs API Calls:**
1. `GET /users/{username}/inventory?sort=listed&sort_order=desc` - Seller inventory (newest first)
2. For each listing, extract: release_id, master_id, format, condition, price

**Data Storage:**
- `sellers/monitored-sellers.json` - List of sellers to track
- `sellers/inventory-cache/{username}.json` - Cached inventory per seller
- `sellers/matches.json` - Current matches with notification status
- `sellers/scan-status.json` - Scan progress state

### Phase 4B: Inventory Scanning Logic

**Scan Algorithm:**

```typescript
async scanSeller(username: string, fullScan: boolean): Promise<SellerMatch[]> {
  const wishlist = await this.wishlistService.getWishlistItems();
  const wishlistMasterIds = new Set(wishlist.map(w => w.masterId));

  const matches: SellerMatch[] = [];
  let page = 1;

  while (true) {
    const inventory = await this.fetchInventoryPage(username, page);

    for (const item of inventory.listings) {
      // Only check vinyl formats
      if (!this.isVinylFormat(item.format)) continue;

      // Check if matches wishlist
      if (item.master_id && wishlistMasterIds.has(item.master_id)) {
        matches.push(this.createMatch(username, item));
      }
    }

    // For quick check, only scan first page (newest listings)
    if (!fullScan || !inventory.pagination.next) break;

    page++;
    await this.rateLimitDelay();
  }

  return matches;
}
```

**Progressive Scan:**
- On startup, check which sellers need scanning (stale > 7 days)
- Scan 2-3 sellers per session to spread API load
- Save progress after each seller to resume on restart

### Phase 4C: Seller Management UI

**New Page: `src/renderer/pages/SellersPage.tsx`**

Layout:
```

```

**Add Seller Dialog:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ [Cancel]                    [Add & Scan]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Seller Validation:**
- On add, verify username exists via `GET /users/{username}`
- Show seller info: avatar, location, feedback score
- Warn if inventory is very large (>5000 items)

### Phase 4D: Match Notifications

**Integration with Notification System (Feature 0D):**

When a new match is found:
```typescript
interface LocalSellerNotification {
  type: 'alert';
  title: 'Wishlist item at local seller!';
  message: '{Artist} - {Album} available at {SellerName} for {Price}';
  action: {
    label: 'View Listing';
    route: '/sellers/{username}/matches';
    externalUrl: 'https://discogs.com/sell/item/{listingId}';
  };
}
```

**Notification Behavior:**
- Equal priority with other wishlist notifications
- One notification per new match (not per scan)
- Mark match as "notified" after creating notification
- Don't re-notify for same listing

### Phase 4E: Matches Page

**New Page: `src/renderer/pages/SellerMatchesPage.tsx`**

Displays all wishlist items found at monitored sellers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Wishlist Items at Local Sellers                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Filter by seller
- Sort by: newest, price, artist
- "Mark as Seen" to dismiss without buying
- "View on Discogs" opens listing in browser
- Show album cover (from collection cache or Discogs)

### Phase 4F: Settings Integration

**Modify: `src/renderer/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`**

Add "Local Sellers" section:
- Quick-add seller form
- List of monitored sellers (manage)
- Scan frequency option (daily quick-check, weekly full)
- Enable/disable notifications for local matches

---

## Feature 5: New Release Tracking (MusicBrainz Integration)

### Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Completed:**
- `MusicBrainzService` for artist search and release fetching (rate-limited, exponential backoff)
- `ReleaseTrackingService` for sync, mapping, and disambiguation management
- `/api/v1/releases/*` routes for all operations (sync, settings, disambiguations, mappings, search, etc.)
- `NewReleasesPage.tsx` with release grid, tabs (All, Upcoming, Recent, Vinyl Available), and filters
- `DisambiguationDialog.tsx` for artist matching UI with candidate selection
- Vinyl availability integration via Discogs search
- Cover Art Archive integration for album artwork
- Auto-match logic for high-confidence artist results (score >= 95)
- Collection artists cache (24-hour retention)
- Data migration registration for 6 new data files
- 36 MusicBrainzService tests + 47 ReleaseTrackingService tests
- All Feature 5 types defined in `shared/types.ts`

**Implementation Details:**
- MusicBrainz rate limit: 1 req/sec with exponential backoff
- Cover Art Archive: 5 req/sec, 30-day caching
- Artist disambiguation: pending → resolved/skipped workflow
- Release types: album, EP, single, compilation, other
- Vinyl status: unknown, checking, available, cd-only, not-found

### Overview
Track new and upcoming releases from artists in your collection using MusicBrainz data, combined with Discogs for vinyl availability.

### Feasibility & Design Decisions

**Artist Matching Disambiguation:**
- MusicBrainz search can return multiple artists with same/similar names
- Strategy:
  1. Search by name: `GET /artist?query={name}`
  2. If single result with high score, auto-match
  3. If multiple results or low confidence, show disambiguation UI
  4. User selects correct artist, mapping is stored permanently

**Disambiguation UI:**
- Show on New Releases page when unmatched artists exist
- Display: Artist name, country, disambiguation text, release count
- "This is the right artist" / "None of these" buttons
- Store confirmed mappings in `releases/artist-mbid-map.json`

**Re-check Cadence:**
- New release check: Weekly when app starts (if stale > 7 days)
- Manual "Check Now" button always available
- Cache release data for 7 days (releases don't change frequently)
- Desktop app may not run continuously, so on-demand when page loads

**Handling Artist Name Variants:**
- Store normalized name (lowercase, no punctuation) as lookup key
- Store original Discogs name for display
- If Discogs has "The Beatles" and MusicBrainz has "Beatles, The", normalize both

### Phase 5A: MusicBrainz Service

**Backend: `src/backend/services/musicbrainzService.ts`**

```typescript
interface MusicBrainzRelease {
  mbid: string;
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  artistMbid: string;
  releaseDate: string | null;
  releaseType: 'album' | 'ep' | 'single' | 'compilation';
  status: 'official' | 'promotion' | 'bootleg';
}

interface ArtistReleases {
  artistName: string;
  artistMbid: string;
  releases: MusicBrainzRelease[];
  lastChecked: number;
}
```

**API Calls:**
- `GET /artist/{mbid}?inc=release-groups` - Get all releases by artist
- Rate limit: 1 request/second (same as Discogs)

**Matching Artists:**
- Use artist names from collection
- Search MusicBrainz for matching artist
- Store mapping: Discogs artist ID → MusicBrainz MBID

### Phase 5B: Release Tracking Service

**Backend: `src/backend/services/releaseTrackingService.ts`**

Track releases from artists in collection:
1. Get list of artists from collection
2. For each artist, fetch releases from MusicBrainz
3. Filter to recent/upcoming releases (past 3 months, future)
4. Store and compare against previous scan
5. Generate "new release" notifications

**Data Storage:**
- `releases/artist-mbid-map.json` - Discogs → MusicBrainz mapping
- `releases/tracked-releases.json` - Known releases per artist
- `releases/new-releases.json` - Newly detected releases

### Phase 5C: New Releases Page

**New Page: `src/renderer/pages/NewReleasesPage.tsx`**

Features:
- List of new/upcoming releases from artists in collection
- Filter by:
  - Release type (album, EP, single)
  - Time frame (last month, last 3 months, upcoming)
  - Artists (specific artist filter)
- Each release shows:
  - Artist - Album
  - Release date
  - Release type badge
  - "Check Vinyl Availability" button (queries Discogs)
  - "Add to Wishlist" button

### Phase 5D: Vinyl Availability for New Releases

**Integration with Feature 2:**

When viewing a new release:
- Query Discogs for matching release
- Show vinyl availability status
- Show price range if vinyl exists
- One-click add to Discogs wishlist

---

## Feature 5.5: Wishlist New Release Tracking

### Status: PLANNED

### Implementation Plan
See `.plan/wishlist-new-release-tracking-plan.md` for full specification.

### Overview
Track new vinyl pressings for albums on your wishlist by monitoring the Discogs master ID to release ID cache. When a master release gets a new vinyl version, notify the user so they can consider purchasing it.

This feature complements Feature 5 (MusicBrainz new release tracking) by focusing on **new pressings of existing albums** rather than **new albums from artists**.

### Key Differences from Feature 5

| Aspect | Feature 5 (MusicBrainz) | Feature 5.5 (Wishlist) |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **What it tracks** | New albums from artists | New pressings of existing albums |
| **Data source** | MusicBrainz release groups | Discogs versions cache |
| **Scope** | Artists in your collection | Albums on your wishlist |
| **Trigger** | Artist creates new album | Label releases new pressing |
| **Use case** | Discover new music | Don't miss limited vinyl runs |

### Data Sources
- **Discogs Wishlist** - `WishlistItem.masterId`
- **Local Want List** - `LocalWantItem.discogsMasterId` (new field)
- **Vinyl Watch List** - `VinylWatchItem.masterId`

### Detection Algorithm
1. Collect master IDs from wishlist, local want list, and vinyl watch list
2. For each master, compare current versions cache against fresh API fetch
3. New release ID detected = vinyl pressing we haven't seen before
4. Filter to vinyl formats only, create notification

### Key Features
- "New Releases" tab on existing Wishlist page
- Notification integration for new pressings
- Source filtering (Discogs wishlist vs local want list)
- Time-based filtering (past 7 days, 30 days)
- Dismiss/acknowledge workflow
- Weekly batch checking with rate limit respect

### Phases
1. **Core Infrastructure** - Types, storage, detection logic, API routes
2. **UI Implementation** - New tab, release cards, filters
3. **Settings & Notifications** - Preferences, notification integration
4. **Optimization** - Batch processing, cleanup routines

---

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
0. **Foundations** - Security baseline, API conventions, notifications - do alongside Feature 1
1. **Stats Dashboard** - Engaging, uses existing data, high user value
2. **Wishlist & Vinyl Tracking** - Directly supports purchasing decisions
3. **Smart Scrobble Scheduling** - Quality of life improvement
4. **Local Seller Monitoring** - Track local record shops for wishlist items
5. **New Release Tracking** - Nice to have, requires additional API integration

### Feature Dependencies

```
Feature 0C (Data Evolution)
    └── Feature 10 (Backup & Restore) - BLOCKED until 0C complete

Feature 1 (Stats Dashboard) - COMPLETE ✅
    └── Feature 9 (Homepage Dashboard) - uses stats components/APIs

Feature 2 (Wishlist) - COMPLETE ✅
    ├── Feature 4 (Seller Monitoring) - COMPLETE ✅ - matches against wishlist
    ├── Feature 5.5 (Wishlist New Releases) - tracks new pressings for wishlist items
    └── Feature 8 (Wishlist Enhancements) - extends wishlist UI

Feature 5 (New Releases) - COMPLETE ✅
    └── Uses MusicBrainz API + Cover Art Archive integration

All other features are independent and can be implemented in any order.
```

**Blockers:**
- Feature 10 (Backup) cannot be implemented until Feature 0C (Data Evolution) is complete
- Feature 0C provides schema versioning needed for backup import compatibility

### Technical Considerations

**Rate Limiting:**
- All features involve external API calls
- Implement request queues with delays
- Cache aggressively (24-hour minimum for version/pricing data)
- Background sync jobs rather than real-time queries

**Data Storage:**
- Continue using JSON file storage pattern
- Add `schemaVersion` to new data files for future migrations
- Consider indexing for large datasets (stats queries)

**Background Job Execution Model:**

Since this is a desktop app (not a server), background jobs run while the app is open:

| Job | Trigger | Frequency | Notes |
|-----|---------|-----------|-------|
| Collection preload | App startup | Once per session | Already implemented |
| Scrobble history sync | App startup + manual | On-demand | Already implemented |
| Wishlist sync | App startup + manual | Daily (if stale) | Check `lastSync` timestamp |
| Version/vinyl scan | After wishlist sync | Progressive (10-20/day) | Rate-limited background |
| Seller quick check | App startup + manual | Daily (if stale) | Page 1 of each seller, newest listings |
| Seller full scan | App startup + manual | Weekly (if stale) | 2-3 sellers per session, progressive |
| Seller match cleanup | After seller scan | Per scan | Mark sold listings, prune >30 days |
| New release check | App startup + manual | Weekly (if stale) | For mapped artists, on-demand on page load |
| Pattern recalculation | After history sync | Weekly | Lightweight, local only |
| Image cache cleanup | App startup | Monthly | Prune entries >30 days old |

**Implementation:**
- On startup, check timestamps in status files to determine what needs running
- Long-running jobs (wishlist scan, release check) run in background with progress indicators
- All jobs are interruptible - save progress to resume on next app launch
- Manual trigger buttons available in Settings for each sync type

**UI Patterns:**
- Reuse existing component patterns (cards, tabs, lists)
- Follow established CSS class conventions
- No inline styles (per CLAUDE.md guidelines)

### Testing Strategy

**Quality Gates per Feature:**

| Feature | Integration Tests | E2E Happy Path |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Stats Dashboard | 1 per route in `stats.ts` | Load stats page, verify data displays |
| Wishlist | 1 per route in `wishlist.ts` | Sync wishlist, view items, filter |
| Smart Scheduling | 1 per route in `patterns.ts` | Backfill 2 albums with auto-timestamps |
| Local Sellers | 1 per route in `sellers.ts` | Add seller, scan inventory, view matches |
| New Releases | 1 per route in `releases.ts` | View releases, disambiguate artist |

**Minimum Requirements:**
- At least 1 integration test per new route group (test actual HTTP request/response)
- At least 1 E2E test per new page (user journey from page load to key action)
- Unit tests for complex service logic (streak calculation, pattern learning)
- Maintain existing coverage baseline for modified files

### Migration Path

Features are independent and can be released incrementally:
1. Stats can be built independently using existing scrobble data
2. Ship wishlist sync without Discovery integration
3. Add Discovery integration after wishlist is stable
4. Smart scheduling can be added to existing scrobble flow incrementally

### Implementation Details
See `.plan/forgotten-favorites-plan.md` for full specification including:
- Backend `statsService.getForgottenFavorites()` method
- `/api/v1/stats/forgotten-favorites` endpoint
- `ForgottenFavoritesTab.tsx` component for Discovery page
- Spotify OAuth integration (Phase 2)

## Feature 8: Wishlist Enhancements

### Status: PLANNED

### Overview
Three enhancements for the Wishlist page:
1. **Sort by scrobble count** - Order items by how often you've listened to that album
2. **Include monitored albums toggle** - Show local want items alongside Discogs wishlist
3. **Better naming conventions** - Clarify Discogs wishlist vs local monitoring

### Key Features
- Batch endpoint for album play count lookup using fuzzy matching
- Merge/dedupe logic for items in both Discogs wishlist and local monitoring
- Consistent terminology: "Wishlist" (Discogs) vs "Monitoring" (local)

### Implementation Details
See `.plan/wishlist-enhancements-plan.md` for full specification including:
- `POST /api/v1/stats/album-play-counts` batch endpoint
- `includeTracked` toggle with deduplication
- UI naming changes across WishlistPage and DiscoveryPage
